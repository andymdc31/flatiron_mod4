    "\n",
    "You will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Cast columns to the appropriate data types\n",
    "* Identify and deal with null values appropriately\n",
    "* Remove unnecessary columns\n",
    "* Understand how to normalize data\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll find the resulting dataset from your work in the _Obtaining Data_ Lab stored within the file `'Lego_data_merged.csv'`.  \n",

    "* Import `pandas` and set the standard alias. \n",

    "* Import `matplotlib.pyplot` and set the standard alias. \n",
    "* Import `seaborn` and set the alias `sns` (this is the standard alias for seaborn). \n",
    "* Use the ipython magic command to set all matplotlib visualizations to display inline in the notebook. \n",
